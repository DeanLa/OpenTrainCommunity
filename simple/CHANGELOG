Oct 7,2014:

did the following:
1. added handle of the dates - might be buggy
2. change assert to CheckException, now has categories and these are count
3. invalid trips are written to log/invalid.txt

need to do:
1. code might be buggy, need to check 
2. add errors for 0 in inner stops ?
3. complete the dump part 
4. check the invalid trips, are these really invalid? bugs in the code, or maybe we should relax the checks

==============================================================================

Oct 7, 2014:
move stop names to stops_utils.py
change names to be in english
unicode(trip) just return short header
trip.unicode_full() return all stops
log/invalid.txt contains all stops

It seems that many issues are related to trips around midnight, probably buggy.

- add count for midnights trips

Hope I fixed the dates. The split accroding to CSV order was wrong, since the first stop of tomorrow is alwasy before the stops that end yesterday trip.
For example, look at 01_2013.txt line 11690 is the first line of the trip that starts in Jan 2, and then there and the second stop is only at line 11714, between 11691 to 11713 is the end of the trip of Jan 1.
Anyhow, there are much few errors now, I checked on 01_2013 and 02_2013 and in each there are about 10-15 invalid from around 9000 trips.
