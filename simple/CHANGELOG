Oct 7,2014:

did the following:
1. added handle of the dates - might be buggy
2. change assert to CheckException, now has categories and these are count
3. invalid trips are written to log/invalid.txt

need to do:
1. code might be buggy, need to check 
2. add errors for 0 in inner stops ?
3. complete the dump part 
4. check the invalid trips, are these really invalid? bugs in the code, or maybe we should relax the checks

==============================================================================

Oct 7, 2014:
move stop names to stops_utils.py
change names to be in english
unicode(trip) just return short header
trip.unicode_full() return all stops
log/invalid.txt contains all stops

It seems that many issues are related to trips around midnight, probably buggy.
