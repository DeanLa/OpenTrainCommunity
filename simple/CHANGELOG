Oct 7,2014:

did the following:
1. added handle of the dates - might be buggy
2. change assert to CheckException, now has categories and these are count
3. invalid trips are written to log/invalid.txt

need to do:
1. code might be buggy, need to check 
2. add errors for 0 in inner stops ?
3. complete teh dump part 
4. check the invalid trips, are these really invalid? bugs in the code, or maybe we should relax the checks
